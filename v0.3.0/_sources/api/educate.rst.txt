Education
=========

The :mod:`pyvrp.educate` module contains classes and methods responsible for educating (improving) a newly created offspring solution.
This happens just after :mod:`pyvrp.crossover` is performed by the :class:`~pyvrp.GeneticAlgorithm.GeneticAlgorithm`.

Node operators
--------------

Instances of these operators can be added to the :class:`~pyvrp.educate.LocalSearch.LocalSearch` object via the :meth:`~pyvrp.educate.LocalSearch.LocalSearch.add_node_operator` method.
As a convenience, the :mod:`pyvrp.educate` module makes all these operators available as ``NODE_OPERATORS``:

.. code-block:: python

   from pyvrp.educate import NODE_OPERATORS
